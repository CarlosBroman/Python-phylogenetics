# Phylogenetics with Biopython and ETE3
During my master's thesis, I started developing my Python and informatics skills. Therefore I did the following:
- Created this GitHub repo
- Automatized every process I had to do using Python or other programming languages
- Developed an app to facilitate the usage of the scripts to non-Python users.
- Used Docker to containerize everything.

This code allows to perform a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) using biopython and clustalW.

## Usage

First we need to download clustalw from http://www.clustal.org/download/current/



## Output

The output will be the tree built with Biopython and render with ETE3.
An application will be built to allow the tree creation.
